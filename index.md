# Summer Training 2019

Welcome to Compete McGill's 2019 Summer Training!

Over the course of the Summer, we hope to teach you some of the Core Algorithmic knowledge for use in Competitive Programming. **In particular**, we hope to teach you how to **write the Algorithms in code**!

Due to limited resources, you'll **have to be a McGill Student or Alumni** to take part :cry: - but if you are, please do not hestitate to join us!

## How does it work?

Every week, we'll assign a section of **[Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/)** (a.k.a CP3) - the mother of all Competitive Programming books for you to read up **on your own**, as well as [Problem Sets](/problemsets/) for you to
practice on. These problems will be hosted on **[CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) and [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/)** - some great Competitive Programming sites! 

Obviously, we're also here to provide you with some support on your Competitive Programming Journey. Join us **weekly on Wednesdays from 7PM - 8:30PM Montreal Time** on [our **Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/JhZQWPW) for a Discussion Session
where we'll walk you through any problems you struggled with!

Please also join our **[Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/856545804677764/)** and ask any questions that you may have during the week!
